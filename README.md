### Hi there!

This is a frontend mentor practice project made with tailwindcss, some postcss and bundled with parcel.

This was an interesting project as I'd never used a bundler, parcel was nice to setup and the docs are just wow!

I got to practice tailwindcss more and learnt more about when grids and flexboxes should be used. I also found out that i need to read the tailwindcss docs on using ::before and ::after

Making the image slider work did take a bit of time(forgot to give the forEach callback an argument) but in the end, I'm happy with the results! P.S i really need to learn how to write in markdown lol. Cheers!!
