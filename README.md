A frontend mentor practice project made with tailwindcss, some postcss and bundled with parcel.
This was an interesting project as I'd never used a bundler, parcel was nice to setup and the docs are just wow!
I got to practice tailwindcss more and learnt more about when grids and flexboxes should be used
As a newbie to web development, making the slider work did take a bit of time(forgot to give forEach an argument) but in the end, I'm happy with the results! Cheers!!
